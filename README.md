# Dashboard OpenWeatherMap

The OpenWeatherMap Dashboard is an interactive visual tool designed to present real-time weather data and detailed forecasts. This program is based on information provided by the OpenWeatherMap API, which offers access to a wide variety of climatic data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and more. Below is a description of how a program based on the title "OpenWeatherMap Dashboard" works.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Testing

To run tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Start

To start the production server:

```bash
yarn start
```
